        <h2 className="section-title">Why Learn C Programming?</h2>
        <p className="section-description">
          C programming is the foundation for many other programming languages like C++, Python, Java, and even JavaScript. It gives you a deep understanding of how computers work at a low level, including memory management and data manipulation. C is widely used in systems programming, embedded systems, game development, and high-performance applications.
